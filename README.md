# Store-Products
In this project, we will design a system for a store that sells different products. The required tasks and classes are:

Product: Resembles a product in the store. We need to know the name, code, price and available quantity of the product.

Order: An order of products. It has customer name, product types and quantities, order date and total price.

Store: This is our store. It should hold an inventory of products and a record of orders, as well as functions to add new products, make an order, show an order and show available products.
